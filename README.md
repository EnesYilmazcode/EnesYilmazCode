## üíª About Me

I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Engineering student at **Ohio State University** (GPA 3.96). I‚Äôve worked on research, internships, and side projects that all tie back to one goal: building tech that makes an impact.  

At **Rockwell Automation**, I built AI agents for pipeline analysis, cutting log review time by 83%. At **Stanford‚Äôs Code in Place**, I taught Python to students from all over the world. I‚Äôve also led projects in AI, automation, and data analysis.  

I like to keep things hands-on: whether it‚Äôs coding AI agents, launching Chrome extensions, or building apps from scratch, I enjoy taking ideas from concept to something people can actually use.
